    "### We generally ask our data to do 1 of 3 things. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1 - We may demand a data sample that is representative of some larger group or population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easiest way: **simple random sample**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Statistics books almost always illustrate this point by drawing colored marbles out of an urn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- If you plan to survey a simple random sample of 100 adults in a neighborhood with 4,328 adults ...\n",
    "- Your methodology has to ensure that every possible sample of 100 adults has an equal chance of being surveyed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- In terms of intuition, you can envision sampling a pot of soup with a single spoonful. \n",
    "- If you’ve stirred your soup adequately, a single spoonful can tell you how the whole pot tastes.\n",

    "For now, you should appreciate several important things: \n",
    "1. A representative sample is a fabulously important thing\n",
    "2. Getting a good sample is harder than it looks. \n",
    "3. Many of the most egregious statistical assertions are caused by good statistical methods applied to bad samples, not the opposite. \n",
    "4. Size matters, and bigger is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "#### 2 - We often ask of data is that they provide some source of comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find two groups of subjects who are broadly similar except for the application of whatever “treatment” we care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other application of the scientific method, we are trying to isolate the impact of one specific intervention or attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “gold standard” of research is randomization, a process by which human subjects (or schools, or hospitals, or whatever we’re studying) are randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group.  \n",
    "- Probability becomes our friend and we assume that randomization will evenly divide all relevant characteristics between the two groups—both the characteristics we can observe, like race or income, but also confounding characteristics that we cannot measure or had not considered, such as perseverance or faith.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "#### 3 - We collect data “Just because.” \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to a crime scene detective who demands that all possible evidence be captured so that it can be sorted later for clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **longitudinal study** collects information on a large group of subjects at many different points in time, such as once every two years.\n",
    "- Longitudinal data sets are the research equivalent of a Ferrari.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Framingham Heart Study\n",
    "- Researchers gathered information on 5,209 adult residents of Framingham in 1948\n",
    "- Researchers have gathered follow-up data from the same participants ever since (and also data on their offspring)\n",
    "- The Framingham data have been used to produce over two thousand academic articles since 1950, including nearly a thousand between 2000 and 2009.\n",

    "**Example**\n",
    "- Perry Preschool Study\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some common examples of “garbage in, garbage out.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection bias. \n",

    "**Example**\n",
    "- “Nixon couldn’t have won. I don’t know anyone who voted for him.”\n",
    "- Lovely example of how a lousy sample (one’s group of liberal friends) can offer a misleading snapshot of a larger population (voters from across America)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- A survey of consumers in an airport is going to be biased by the fact that people who fly are likely to be wealthier than the general public \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- If you ask 100 people in a public place to complete a short survey, and 60 are willing to answer your questions, \n",
    "- Those 60 are likely to be different in significant ways from the 40 who walked by without making eye contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Literary Digest poll of 1936\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can end up with the same basic problem when we compare outcomes between a **treatment** and a **control group** if the mechanism for sorting individuals into one group or the other is not random. \n",

    "- There are three common treatments for prostate cancer\n",
    "- Can one look at these data and assume that brachytherapy is least likely to damage a man’s sexual function? No, no, no. \n",
    "- The men who receive this treatment are generally younger and fitter than men who receive the other treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A related source of bias, known as **self-selection bias**, will arise whenever individuals volunteer to be in a treatment group. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Prisoners who volunteer for a drug treatment group are different from other prisoners because they have volunteered to be in a drug treatment program\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Publication bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "Positive findings are more likely to be published than negative findings, which can skew the results that we see. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Suppose you have just conducted a rigorous, longitudinal study in which you find conclusively that playing video games does not prevent colon cancer. \n",
    "- No one will print it\n",
    "- The net effect is to distort the research that we see, or do not see.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one important recurring idea in statistics is that unusual things happen every once in a while, just as a matter of chance. \n",
    "- If you conduct 100 studies, one of them is likely to turn up results that are pure nonsense\n",
    "- Like a statistical association between playing video games and a lower incidence of colon cancer. \n",
    "- Here is the problem: The 99 studies that find no link between video games and colon cancer will not get published, because they are not very interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- “The makers of antidepressants like Prozac and Paxil never published the results of about a third of the drug trials that they conducted to win government approval, misleading doctors and consumers about the drugs’ true effectiveness.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this problem, medical journals now typically require that any study be registered at the beginning of the project if it is to be eligible for publication later on. \n",
    "- If 100 studies are registered that propose to examine the effect of skateboarding on heart disease, and only one is ultimately submitted for publication with positive findings, the editors can infer that the other studies had nonpositive findings.\n",

    "---\n",

    "#### Recall bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have a natural human impulse to understand the present as a logical consequence of things that happened in the past — cause and effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- The study in 1993 looking at the relationship between diet and cancer.\n",
    "- They searched their own memories for a cause and then summoned that cause into memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Survivorship bias \n",
    "\n",
    "Survivorship bias, occurs when some or many of the observations are falling out of the sample, changing the composition of the observations that are left and therefore affecting the results of any analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- If you have a room of people with varying heights, forcing the short people to leave will raise the average height in the room, but it doesn’t make anyone taller.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- The mutual fund industry has aggressively (and insidiously) seized on survivorship bias to make its returns look better to investors than they really are.\n",
    "- It is relatively hard to beat the S&P 500 for any consistent stretch of time.\n",
    "- Mutual funds with unimpressive returns relative to the S&P 500 are quietly closed. \n",
    "- (Their assets are folded into other existing funds.) \n",
    "- The company can then heavily advertise the two or three new funds that have “consistently outperformed the S&P 500” - even if that performance is the stock-picking equivalent of flipping three heads in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Healthy user bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- People who take vitamins regularly are likely to be healthy because they are the kind of people who take vitamins regularly!\n",
    "- Whether the vitamins have any impact is a separate issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "“At its simplest, the problem is that people who faithfully engage in activities that are good for them - taking a drug as prescribed, for instance, or eating what they believe is a healthy diet - are fundamentally different from those who don’t.”"

    "    - For a overview of how polling is generally done see pages 178 - 179\n",
    "    -\n",

    "        - A low response rate can be a warning sign for potential sampling bias. \n",
    "        - The more people there are who opt not to answer the poll, or who just can’t be reached, the greater the possibility that this large group is different in some material way from those who did answer the questions. \n",
    "        - Pollsters can test for “nonresponse bias”\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Have the questions been posed in a way that elicits accurate information on the topic of interest?** \n",
    "    - **Example**\n",
    "    - The percentage of Americans supporting capital punishment has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range from a high of 70 percent in 2003 to a low of 64 percent at several different points. \n",
    "    - Or not. American support for the death penalty plummets when life imprisonment without parole is offered as an alternative. \n",

    "        - Voters are less concerned about “climate change” than they are about “global warming,” \n",
    "        - Similarly, if answers are to be compared over time—such as how consumers feel about the economy today compared with how they felt a year ago—then the questions eliciting that information over time must be the same, or very similar.\n",
    "        - Polling organizations like Gallup will often conduct “split sample testing,” in which variations of a question are tested on different samples to gauge how small changes in wording affect respondents’ answers. \n",
    "                \n",
    "3. **Are respondents telling the truth?** \n",
    "    - Polling is like Internet dating\n",
    "    - Studies that have compared self-reported voting behavior to election records consistently find that one-quarter to one-third of respondents say they voted when in fact they did not.\n",
    "    - One way to minimize this potential bias is to ask whether a respondent voted in the last election, or in the last several elections :)\n",
